# CMSE830 Midterm Project

## Global Energy and Electricity Production Analysis (2000-2020)

### Project Overview

This project aims to explore global trends in energy consumption and electricity production from 2000 to 2020. By using two comprehensive datasets, I analyze how the global transition toward sustainable energy sources has impacted electricity generation across different countries and regions. The interactive visualizations in this project provide users with an intuitive understanding of energy consumption patterns and how nations have embraced renewable energy to address global environmental challenges.

### Datasets

This project utilizes the following datasets:

**1.	Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020):**

This dataset provides indicators related to sustainable energy usage across different countries, including electricity access, renewable energy adoption, carbon emissions, and energy intensity. It covers key factors that are essential to understanding the progress towards sustainable energy development.

**2.	Global Electricity Statistics (1980-2021):**

This dataset contains detailed statistics on global electricity production, with a focus on the different sources of electricity, including fossil fuels and renewables. It also provides insights into energy generation capacity and total electricity consumption by country.

The two datasets complement each other by providing a full picture of how energy consumption patterns have changed globally. The electricity statistics help understand the production and supply side, while the sustainable energy dataset offers a view into the consumption and environmental impact.

### Key Features

- **3D Phase Field Modeling**: Simulation of crystal growth using FEM.
- **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**: Dynamic adjustment of mesh elements to accurately model surface changes, influencing computational demands.
- **Performance Comparison**: Analysis of CPU and memory consumption, along with computation time, across various model sizes and configurations.
- **Cross-Platform Efficiency Evaluation**: Comparison of different CPU resources that HPCC provided to identify the most efficient computational strategy.
- **Interactive Visualization**: 

### Usage

This project is implemented using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing users to interact with the simulation data and explore various scenarios. The app provides real-time visualizations and analysis tools to help users identify the most efficient computational strategies for their specific needs.
